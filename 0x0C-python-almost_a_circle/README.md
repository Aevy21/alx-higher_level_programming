# Almost a Circle - Python Concept Testing

## Overview

"Almost a Circle" is a Python project designed for testing and reviewing key concepts in the Python programming language. This project covers a range of fundamental concepts, providing a hands-on opportunity to explore and understand the following topics:

- Importing modules
- Handling exceptions
- Creating and using classes
- Implementing private attributes
- Working with getter and setter methods
- Utilizing class methods and static methods
- Exploring inheritance in Python
- Writing unit tests

## Usage

To explore and test Python concepts in "Almost a Circle," follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aevy21/almost-a-circle.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd almost-a-circle
    ```

3. Run the project:

    ```bash
    python almost_a_circle.py
    ```

4. Explore the codebase to find examples and implementations related to the Python concepts mentioned above.

## Concepts Covered

### Import

The project demonstrates the use of import statements to include external modules and libraries.

### Exceptions

Explore how the project handles exceptions to manage errors gracefully.

### Class

Learn about the implementation and usage of classes to organize code and data.

### Private Attribute

Discover how private attributes are used to encapsulate and protect class members.

### Getter/Setter

See examples of getter and setter methods for controlled access to class attributes.

### Class Method

Understand the concept of class methods, which operate on the class itself rather than instances.

### Static Method

Explore the use of static methods that don't depend on class instances.

### Inheritance

Review examples of inheritance, where classes can inherit attributes and methods from others.

### Unittest

The project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the implemented code.
