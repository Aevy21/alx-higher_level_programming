## What Are Higher-Level Programming Languages?

Higher-level programming languages are a class of programming languages that offer a higher level of abstraction, making it easier for developers to write code without needing to delve into the intricate details of a computer's hardware. They are designed to be more user-friendly and closer to natural language, allowing programmers to focus on solving problems and implementing algorithms with less concern for low-level implementation details.

## Why Are They Important?

Higher-level programming languages are important for several reasons:
- **Ease of Use:** They provide a more intuitive and readable syntax, reducing the learning curve for new developers.
- **Abstraction:** Developers can work with built-in data structures, libraries, and functions, simplifying common programming tasks.
- **Readability:** Code written in higher-level languages is typically more readable and easier to maintain.
- **Productivity:** They encourage faster development and enable the creation of more complex applications in less time.
- **Portability:** Code can often be run on multiple platforms with minimal modification.

## HIGHER LEVEL LANGUAGE
- **Python:** Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is widely used in web development, data science, and more.
