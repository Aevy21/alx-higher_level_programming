# Python Everything is an Object

In Python, everything is an object. This means that every value in Python is an instance of an object, including numbers, strings, functions, and even modules.

## Understanding Objects in Python

In Python, objects are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and every value in Python is an instance of some class. Understanding that everything in Python is an object allows for a more consistent and intuitive approach to programming.

## Everything is an Object

In Python, even basic data types like integers, strings, and booleans are objects. For example:

```python
number = 42
string = "Hello, Python!"
boolean = True

print(type(number))  # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(string))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(boolean)) # Output: <class 'bool'>
```

This demonstrates that fundamental data types in Python are instances of their respective classes.

## Checking Object Type

To check the type of an object, you can use the `type()` function:

```python
my_variable = 42
print(type(my_variable))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

This demonstrates that `my_variable` is of type `int`.

## Exploring Object Contents

### dir() Function

The `dir()` function can be used to get a list of all attributes and methods of an object:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(dir(my_list))
```

This will output a list of attributes and methods that you can use with the `my_list` object.

### hasattr() Function

You can use the `hasattr()` function to check if an object has a specific attribute or method:

```python
if hasattr(my_list, 'append'):
    print("my_list has an 'append' method.")
```

This example checks if the `append` method exists for the `my_list` object.

### Getting Help with help()

The `help()` function provides documentation on an object:

```python
help(my_list)
```

This will display information about the `my_list` object, including its methods and usage.

## Conclusion

Understanding that everything in Python is an object is fundamental to writing effective and consistent code. Use the provided techniques to explore and understand the objects you work with in Python.
